                        <p>Hello! I’m Aldo Adirajasa Fathoni, or just call me Aldo. I’m currently a Vocational High School student at IDN Boarding School Solo, majoring in Software Engineering. In the development of this website, I manage anything related to the administration and do research for the contents.</p>
                        <p>I like computers, technology-related stuffs, knowing how they work and finding their potential in daily lives. So I think this website is really great, both for us the developers, and hopefully the users.</p>

                        <p>Hello everyone, my name is Rafi Asyam. I'm 17 years old and I'm from Boyolali, Central Java . Now I'm a student at IDN Boarding School Solo, I major in Software Engineering. I play a role as the designer in this website development.</p>
                        <p>My interest in IT in terms of making applications, editing videos, making designs, is indeed a lot and I like self-learning, therefore the knowledge I can attach to and is easy to re-learn.</p>

                        <p>Howdy everyone! I'm Nur Ihsan Al Ghifari, or people usually call me Ihsan! I'm the main developer of this website.</p>
                        <p>I'm from Surakarta, right next to IDN Solo - but not quite, it's about 35km away and yet I found out my house to be the nearest of all students of IDN Solo. I'm 15 and likes to code, I've been interested in computer thingies since I was little.</p>
                        <p>I'm a new student of IDN Solo but got the audacity to attend an IDN ITFEST competition right after I finished the school introductory program, how awesome and troubling that is lol. I'm not really used to having a bunch of projects in IDN, now plus the added pain of developing this website, not to mention how I got sick for 3 days, aarggh being in IDN is tough. But thankfully everything has been going alright so far. (insert the "this is fine" meme)</p>
                        <p>That's a small peek of my personal life, but <i>"talk is cheap, show me the code"</i> - Linus Torvalds; so here's my github: <a href="https://github.com/Iyxan23">Iyxan23</a></p>
